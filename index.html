            <h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>
            <p>Here are a few of my hobbies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reading Books</li> I was an avid reader before devoting all my attention to crak JEE. During my Senior Secondary years, the only books I read were academic. I remember enjoying the likes of <i>The Famous Five</i> and <i>The Secret Seven</i> when I was a kid.
                                                                   Then I got my hands on a very beautiful book series, which is no lesser than an epic, <i>The Harry Potter Series</i>. I thoroughly enjoyed reading them and I would like to appreciate the marvellous, to say the least, story crafter by J.K. Rowling.
                                                                   I have also read some books written by Dan Brown which are all packed with thrill, adventure and knowledge. <i>The Da Vinci Code</i> is a must read. Recently, I have switched gears to self-help books and have finished reading Atomic Habits by James Clear, The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari by Robin Sharma and am currently reading The Power of Your Subconscious Mind by Dr. Joseph Murphy.
                <li>Cricket</li> Who isn't a cricket fan in India? ;p
                <li>Coding</li> I love coding as a hobby and always look forward to expand my knowledge base.
                <li>Podcasts</li> I listen to various podcasts in my free time which include Purpose by Jay Shetty, The Fighter Pilot Podcast by Vincent Aeillo, etc.
            </ul>
            <h2 id="amb">Ambitions</h2>
            <p>I have been fascinated with space and aviation technology since childhood. I wish to expand my knowledge in Aerospace Engineering and Avionics in the future.</p>
